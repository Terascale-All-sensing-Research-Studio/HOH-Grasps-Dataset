## Description

we present HOH-Grasps, derived from the [HOH dataset](https://tars-home.github.io/hohdataset/). The original HOH dataset comprises a large-scale collection of 3D point cloud data from 2,720 handover interactions involving 136 distinct objects and 20 unique pairs of givers and receivers. HOH captures data via multi-view markerless motion capture technology and records detailed handover interactions where a giver picks up an object from a table and transfers it to a receiver.

Our HOH-Grasps dataset extracts segmented point clouds of objects, giver hands, and receiver hands from the HOH dataset and aligns them at two critical frames: the moment right before human grasping and the moment of handover. We define a standardized coordinate system different from the original HOH dataset, placing the origin above the scene with the Z-axis oriented downward toward the object center, aligning with typical camera viewpoints used in robotic grasping experiments. For simulating realistic scenarios, each object point cloud is combined with a dummy planar surface beneath it to emulate a tabletop setting, along with binary masks distinguishing objects from the dummy surface. Additionally, we provide ground truth centroids of objects and giver/receiver hands aligned at both frames. Corresponding transformations are also extracted.

Grasp labels for each object are generated using an analytical method proposed by [GraspNet](https://graspnet.net/). Grasp points are sampled across the surface of each 3D mesh, and 14,400 grasps per sample point. Collision indicators, grasp scores, and tolerance labels are computed for each grasp.
